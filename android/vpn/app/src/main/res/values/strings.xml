    <string name="info">NewNode uses a peer to peer network to get around blocking and to establish a good internet connection when connectivity is sparse.
        \n\n
        NewNode sends your traffic through a peer network that makes connections through user devices rather than relying on a central server. This, along with encrypting and obfuscating the traffic, makes NewNode very robust at content access.
